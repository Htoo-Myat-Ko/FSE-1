First, you don’t perform long-running computations in the main process, you move them to a different process. This can be achieved via the Worker API.

Second, you don’t (synchronously) wait for the results of a long-running computation (your own algorithm in a Worker process, a network request, etc.), you carry on with the event loop and let the computation notify you when it is finished. In fact, you usually don’t even have a choice in browsers and have to do things this way. For example, there is no built-in way to sleep synchronously (like the previously implemented sleep()). Instead, setTimeout() lets you sleep asynchronously.
